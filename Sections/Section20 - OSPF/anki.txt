OSPF uses [...] algorithm to determine the best path to learned networks.
A: Djisktra Shortest Path First

OSPF is a [...] routing protocol.
A: Link State Routing Protocol

OSPF routers use these advertisements to pass on routing updates.
A: Link State Advertisements (LSA)

A router will send out and listen for [...] packets when OSPF is enabled on an interface.
A: Hello

Adjacent OSPF routers will tell each other the networks they know about using this packet.
A: DataBase Description

What OSPF packet type is sent by a router to its neighbor if it's missing information about any of the networks in the received DBD?
A: LSR(Link state request)

What OSPF packet contains a list of LSAs which should be updated?
A: LSU (Link state updated)

What does 10 signify in the command below?
Router(config)#router ospf 10
A: Process ID

OSPF routers identify themselves using an OSPF [...] which is in the form of an IPv4 address.
A: Router ID 

The rate that Ethernet interfaces physically transmit at is set by the [...] command.
A: speed

[...] interfaces transmit at 1000 Mbps by default.
A: GigabitEthernet

FastEthernet interfaces transmit at [...] Mbps by default.
A: 100

The rate that Serial interfaces physically transmit at is set by the [...] command.
A: clock rate

Serial interfaces transmit at what rate by default?
A: 1.544 Mbps 

The [...] command affects software policy on a router, such as which path will be selected by EIGRP or OSPF.
A: bandwidth

Cost = [...] / Interface Bandwidth
A: reference bandwidth

What command will you enter to manually specify an OSPF cost value of 15? 
R1(config-if)# ?
A: ip ospf cost 15

It is how long a router waits to hear from a neighbor before declaring it out of service. The default is 4x the Hello Interval.
A: Dead Interval

This is how often a router sends Hello packets. The default is 10 secs.
A: Hello interval

In a multi-area setup, the OSPF area 0 or "backbone" area does generally not contain end users. It is for [...] traffic only.
A: transit

OSPF routers use these advertisements to pass on routing updates.
A: LSA(link state Advertisment)

Adjacent OSPF routers will tell each other the networks they know about using this packet.
A: DataBase Description(DBD)

Serial interfaces transmit at what rate by default?
A: 1.544Mbps
