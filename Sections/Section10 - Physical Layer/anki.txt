This OSI layer puts the actual bits onto the wire.
A: Physical Layer

This OSI layer provides the hardware means of sending and receiving data, including defining cables, 
interface cards and physical aspects. 
A: Physical Layer

What does UTP stand for?
A: UTP - unshielded twisted pair

The OSI Layer 1 conveys the [...], which could be electrical impulse, light or radio signals. 
A: bitstream

These Ethernet cables are used to connect devices of different types together, 
such as a PC or router to a switch or hub.
A: straight through cables

These cables are most often used to connect two devices of the same type directly, 
like two switches to each other.
A: crossover cables

Modern switches support [...] where the receive and transmit 
signals are reconfigured automatically to yield the expected result.
A: Auto MDI-X

The two types of fiber optic cables are [...] and Multi Mode.
A: Single Mode

This fiber cable type is more expensive and supports higher bandwidth and longer distances.
A: Single Mode

What does PoE stand for?
A: Power over Ethernet

It delivers power to the devices over the standard network cable. 
This saves you from using a separate power supply for all connected devices.
A: Power over Ethernet(PoE)

What's the maximum length of UTP cables?
A: 100 metres

With Auto MDI-X disabled, what UTP cable is used to connect the device below?
A: Crossover cable

With Auto MDI-X disabled, what UTP cables are used to connect the devices below?
A: Straight-through Cable

What connector type is on the end of a standard UTP cable?
A: RJ-45

This fiber cable type supports a few hundred meters maximum distance.
A: MultiMode Cable

With fiber optical cables, the connector typically plugs into a [...], 
which then plugs into the switch or router.
A: transceiver
