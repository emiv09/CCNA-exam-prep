Hubs operate in this duplex mode.
A: Half-Duplex

Hubs operate at the [...] of the OSI model.
A: Layer-1

In this duplex mode, the attached hosts can either send or receive data. 
They can't do both at the same time.
A: Half Duplex

The method that is used for detecting and recovering from collisions is [...].
A: CSMA/CD

What does the acronym CSMA/CD stand for?
A: Carrier-Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection

When operating in this duplex mode, the attached host can both 
send and receive data at the same time using their receive and transmit wires.
A: Full-Duplex mode

With this duplex mode, all hosts have their own dedicated collision domain.
A: Full-Duplex

These are advanced switches that are Layer 3 aware 
and can route traffic between different IP subnets.
A: Layer 3 Switches

Layer 2 switches are [...] address aware.
A: MAC

A Layer [...] device is needed to route traffic between different subnets.
A: 3

The switch MAC address table is empty. PC2 sends traffic to PC3. 
What MAC address will the switch enter in the MAC address table?
A: PC2 (0002.2222.000B)

The switch MAC address table is empty. PC2 sends traffic to PC3. 
What Port will the switch enter in the MAC address table?
A:F0/2

The switch received traffic to an unknown unicast address from PC4. 
The switch will send it out all ports, except port [...].
A:F0/4

PC1 receives a frame with a destination MAC address of 0003.3333.000C. 
What will PC1 do with the frame?
A: Discard/Drop the frame

The switch MAC address table has a single existing entry of 0001.1111.000A 
mapped to Port F0/1. PC4 sends traffic to PC1. 
What MAC address will the switch enter in the MAC address table?
A:0004.4444.000D

The switch MAC address table has an existing entry of 0003.3333.000C mapped to Port F0/3. 
PC1 sends traffic to PC3. Which port/s will the switch forward the traffic to?
A: F0/3

The switch is just plugged into the network. It receives a frame with a 
source MAC address of 1001.00A5.30A9 and a destination MAC address of 505C.1000.F008. 
What MAC address will the switch enter on its MAC address table?
A: 1001.00A5.30A9

Devices connected to a Hub are in the same [...] domain.
A: collision

Whenever a switch receives a frame for the [...] address or an unknown unicast address, 
it will be flooded out all ports apart from the one it was received on.
A: broadcast

Whenever a switch receives a frame for the broadcast address or an unknown [...] address, 
it will be flooded out all ports apart from the one it was received on.
A: unicast
